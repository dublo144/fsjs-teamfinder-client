## Teamfinder application client

---

**NB**: This client application is still a work in progress, reason being that I have spent the time refactoring and refining the [backend](https://github.com/dublo144/fsjs-teamfinder-backend). **Please see the description in the backend**.

However I have spent some time in the client, in order to get the JWT style authentication up and running.
This introduced the React Context Api to the client, with an [authContext](https://github.com/dublo144/fsjs-teamfinder-client/blob/master/contexts/AuthContext.jsx) to handle sign ins.
